In the event of a single Availability Zone (AZ) outage, where one AZ becomes unavailable, the RTO for a Multi-AZ database can be minimal. This is because the database automatically fails over to the standby replica in the alternate AZ, ensuring minimal downtime. The failover process is typically completed within seconds or minutes, allowing applications to quickly resume normal operations.

In the case of a single region outage, where an entire AWS region becomes unavailable, the RTO for a Multi-AZ, multi-region database can be slightly longer. The failover process involves promoting the standby replica in the alternate region to become the new primary database. This process may take longer due to the need to establish connectivity and synchronize data across regions. However, with proper configuration and automation, the RTO can still be relatively short, typically ranging from a few minutes to an hour.

The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) refers to the acceptable amount of data loss in case of a failure. For a Multi-AZ database, the RPO for a single AZ outage is typically minimal or zero. This is because the primary database and the standby replica in the alternate AZ are continuously synchronized, ensuring that data changes are replicated in near real-time. Therefore, in the event of an AZ failure, the failover to the standby replica ensures that only a minimal amount of data, if any, is lost.

In the case of a single region outage, the RPO for a Multi-AZ, multi-region database can be slightly higher. Although the primary and standby replicas are synchronized within the same region, there may be a slight delay in replicating data across regions. Therefore, the RPO for a single region outage can range from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the replication latency between regions.
